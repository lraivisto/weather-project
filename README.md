# Weather Project
  This is a group project where we had to output json data into graphs and show different information based on the days and weather.
 
 
 ## Using the program
 * Clone the repository:
 `https://github.com/lraivisto/weather-project`
 
 * In the repository folder, start the client side:
 `node palvelin.js`
 
 * In the repository folder, start the server side on a different terminal instance:
 `node indexREST.js`
 
 * Go into your browser and type:
 `localhost:3000`
 
 * Type a month (1-12) into the textbox and press temperature or rain, then click send.
